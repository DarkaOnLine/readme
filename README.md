## Laravel Validation Rules

This organisation contains extra Rule classes that can be used with 
Laravel's validation engine.


### Namespace

To keep things consistent, please use the top level namespace `LVR`.


### Current Rules

 - [Timezone](https://github.com/laravel-validation-rules/timezone): validates a given timezone string. 


### Contributing

If you'd like to add a Rule to the collection, please send the name of your 
Rule in a quick email to scott@dor.ky and I'll create an empty repository 
and assign you permissions to it.

Ideally, license your Rule with an Apache 2.0 license along with tests that 
prove it passes and fails under expected conditions. Your code should be 
formatted to PSR2 standards. After adding your code to your repository, 
add it to Packagist (or include in your email if you'd like me to do this).
